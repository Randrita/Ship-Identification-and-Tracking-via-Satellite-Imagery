# Ship Identification and Tracking via Satellite Imagery


## WHY SHIP IDENTIFICATION? ##
* Ship detection is important for marine security. 
* This is done through the use of an Automated Identification System (AIS).
* AIS uses VHF radio frequencies.
* It fails to detect those ships Â those which disconnect their VHF transponder.
* This is where satellite imagery and image processing come to rescue.
